Markdown Tree
=============

What is it?
-----------
Take a folder with a hierarchy of markdown files and use this script to serve that folder as a live styled site with a built in navigation.

Basically this is a Sinatra script to serve a hierarchy / tree directory of markdown files as a live dynamic site. Use intended for small sites built in markdown.


Why
---
There are many similar scripts done in a static fashion but I couldn't find a minimal system for serving markdown hierarchy based sites that was dynamic.

For that reason I created Markdown Tree. Having a dynamically generated site allows me to not have to worry about regenerating my site every time I make a minor change.
